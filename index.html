            <p>Carlos is a blue parakeet/budgerigar that my older sister adopted from her friend in high school. Carlos is 9 years old and loves flying around the kitchen and standing on chandeliers. She has very loud chirps and loves to chatter when people play instruments. Although she can be aggressive at times and is very unfriendly towards strangers, she has a very soft bite.</p>
            <p>Carlos has a sister named Einstein. We did not discover the genders of our pet birds until years after we named them. At night, Carlos always sleeps on her favorite yellow swing and will wake up in the same spot every morning in the upstairs of her cage ready to come out and play.</p>

            <p>Finn is a 7 year old grey cat. I feel like no one really knows cat breeds so I’m just gonna go with grey. He loves doing tricks for treats and his favorite is giving high fives to people. He might as well be a dog as he loves the outdoors and meeting new people. I can only describe him as goofy and chaotic. </p>
            <p>Finn’s biggest enemy is his vet. I don't know whether or not it’s because his vet is an MSU alum, but he doesn’t like him. He actually has to be prescribed a sedative before he goes to the vet office because he’ll suddenly act like he was never a house cat for 7 years.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
        <p>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</p>

        <img src="images\Dollar1.png" alt="Black, white and brown australian shepherd in a playpen looking up." width=400>
        </div>
        <p>Dollar is a 1 and a half year old Australian shepherd. His favorite games are tug of war and fetch. Sometimes, when he goes out for walks, he will pick up a stick to get his owners to play fetch with him. At night, he likes to cuddle with his owners. He would snuggle up and put his nose on their arm to let them know that he wants pets. </p>
        <p>Dollar has a gourmet taste for food. He hates eating kibble and will only eat premium chicken bits with eggs. His favorite snacks are bell peppers, beef bits, and peanut butter. Dollar is incredibly smart and will only do tricks when you present him with snacks.             </p>

        <img src="images\cheeto_cattree.jpg" alt="Orange cat hanging paws off a cat tower" width="400">
        </div>
        <p>Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get outside every single day. If he isn`t causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and sleeping. </p>
        <p>Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged. </p>
